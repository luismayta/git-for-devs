Problem
-------


Currently we don't have the best way to use git.
Moreover we don't have a absolute fix structure
in git repositories.



Substantiation
--------------

- We want to use git flow, to  have in future a better structure of products and a better handling. 

- If we would use git flow we could work much more efficiently

- With git flow life get's much easier 

- Git is cool... but with git flow it's much cooler ;) 



We do it so!

This picture shows the work flow, which we want to use in future. 
Remember this to understand git flow.
